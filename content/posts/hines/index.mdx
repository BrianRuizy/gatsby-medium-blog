## C. The result
In the end we have a fully functional application that is responsive and works on all devices. Furthermore, Django allows for future proofing our applications and taking a RESTful approach and incorporating a JS framework. lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
