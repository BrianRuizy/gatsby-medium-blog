# Joining Hines

In May 2021, I joined the application development team at Hines —one of the largest privately held real estate investors and managers in the world. Our team is responsible for building a suite of applications that help Hines manage its $81.7B Portfolio of Assets Under Management, serving 27 countries worldwide, and doing so successfully for over 64 years.

# Transforming the industry

At Hines, we believe strongly in pushing the boundaries to shape the future and build a better world by getting into a state of mind of innovation. It is a goal to transform the real estate industry by placing innovation at the very core of the company. Best said by the company’s founder:

What differentiates Hines is <mark>a tailored approach to global real estate investing</mark>. We continue to evaluate and incorporate new technologies, as opposed to only using cookie-cutter solutions.


> I believe we can always improve, either by rethinking existing ways of doing things, or by thinking outside the box. This is innovation.
> --Gerald D. Hines
